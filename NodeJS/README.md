# NodeJS server
This portion of the code is for a node.js powered server to push chicken coop status and statistics to.
It also provides a nice front-end to view real-time status and statistics of the coop, including;
- Temperature and light level real-time graphs
- On/off indications for coop light and water heater
- Open/Closed indication for coop door
